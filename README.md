# Defguard desktop client

Desktop client for managing WireGuard VPN connections (any WireGuard server and [defguard](https://github.com/DefGuard/defguard) instances).

![defguard desktop client](https://defguard.net/images/product/client/main-screen.png)

## Features

- Supports any WireGuard server
- Multi-platform - Linux, macOS & Windows
- Detailed network overview - see all details of your connection history and statistics with real-time charts and logs
- Multi-Factor Authentication with TOTP/Email & WireGuard PSK - Since WireGuard protocol doesn't support 2FA, most (if not all) available WireGuard clients use 2FA authorization to the "application" itself (not Wireguard tunnel). When using this client with [defguard VPN & SSO server](https://github.com/DefGuard/defguard) (which is <strong>free & open source</strong>) you will get <strong>real Multi-Factor Authentication using TOTP/Email codes + WireGuard Pre-shared session keys</strong>.
- Multiple instances & locations - When combining with [defguard](https://github.com/DefGuard/defguard) VPN & SSO you can have multiple defguard instances (sites/installations) and multiple Locations (VPN tunnels in that location/site) in <strong>one client</strong>! If you are an admin/devops - all your customers (instances) and all their tunnels (locations) can be in one place!
- Fast! - Built with Rust, [tauri](https://tauri.app/) and [React.js](https://react.dev/).

To learn more about the system see our [documentation](https://defguard.gitbook.io).

## Development

### Tauri requirements

Make sure to install prerequisites from [tauri](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites/).

### Proto submodule
Make sure you have cloned, and up to date, proto submodule in `src-tauri/proto`

### Protoc compiler
Make sure you have [protoc](https://grpc.io/docs/protoc-installation/) available.

### Install pnpm and node deps

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Sqlx and local database file

To work with sqlx on a local db file, you'll have to set `DATABASE_URL` env variable.
It's best to set it to absolute path since `pnpm tauri dev` runs with weird paths.

Init the file with:

```bash
export DATABASE_URL=sqlite://<full-path-to-project-dir>/dev.db`
sqlx db create
sqlx migrate run --source src-tauri/migrations/
```

Then keep the `$DATABASE_URL` set during development (use direnv etc.)

### Dev server command

```bash
pnpm tauri dev
```

### Build command
```bash
pnpm tauri build
```
Built packages are available after in `src-tauri/target/release/bundle`.

### Windows

Remove `default-run` line from `[package]` section in `Cargo.toml` to build the project.

# Known issues

## Failed to bundle project

`pnpm tauri build` may fail with error: `Error failed to bundle project: error running appimage.sh`. To
fix this set the NO_STRIP environment variable:

```
NO_STRIP=1 pnpm tauri build
```

## Blank screen

The app launches but the window is blank. Set the `WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER` environment variable:

```
WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1 defguard-client
```

## Failed to run `pnpm tauri dev`

`pnpm tauri dev` command may result in the following error:

```
Error [ERR_REQUIRE_ESM]: require() of ES Module /home/jck/workspace/work/teonite/defguard/client/node_modules/.pnpm/path-type@5.0.0/node_modules/path-type/index.js from /home/jck/workspace/work/teonite/defguard/client/node_modules/.pnpm/read-pkg@3.0.0/node_modules/read-pkg/index.js not supported.
Instead change the require of /home/jck/workspace/work/teonite/defguard/client/node_modules/.pnpm/path-type@5.0.0/node_modules/path-type/index.js in /home/jck/workspace/work/teonite/defguard/client/node_modules/.pnpm/read-pkg@3.0.0/node_modules/read-pkg/index.js to a dynamic import() which is available in all CommonJS modules.

}

Node.js v22.7.0
 ELIFECYCLE  Command failed with exit code 1.
       Error The "beforeDevCommand" terminated with a non-zero status code.
 ELIFECYCLE  Command failed with exit code 1.
```

To fix this remove node_modules and rerun `pnpm install`.
